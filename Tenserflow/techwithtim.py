"""   
    Difference artificaial intelligence vs machine learning and neural Networks

    AI : intellectual tasks to be done my humans to be done by machines. make them think like humans
    in previous terms it was simple with just some simple set of instructions which may be complex depending on the porgram and
    conditions.  

    Machine Learning : the rules are figured out by the machine we dont have to tell the rules but the trainning data is to be large 
    as we have to make the model for the same

    Deep Learning : Neural Netorks  :  In this we have the input layer the output layer and the set of the rules in between the layers 

    Note  :  They are not modelled from the brains.  




    Mahcine Learning  : Features and Labels : Features are sued for the markign the label.
    Types fo Machine Learning  :  

    Unsupervised Learning  
    Supervised Learning  
    Reinforcement Learning 

    Supervised Learning  :  Features and label features helps to predict the labels
    ** Check for the methods and models and  algo available for this 

    Unsupervised Learning  : Make the model to get the model gets the features and determines the label itself 
    it determines the lables inthe cluster itself

    Reinforcement Learning  :  the model learns itself from the rewards and learns from the environment and this enables the model 
    to learn itself.  

    Tenserflow is the open source machine learning library and we can use this without knowing the much of the maths
